        About me
        </h1>
          <p>My professional journey in IT started in 2016. I started with web development. By trial and error, I learned how to troubleshoot and use online information when needed. I am grateful for the internet and all its tools that enabled me to work as a cloud system administrator. Some of the tools I use are Python, Shell, Docker, Kubernetes and it is good to know how to call an API.</p>
          <p>I have always been curious about technology and I am trying to learn something new every day. I also speak Czech, English, French, and a little Spanish.</p>
