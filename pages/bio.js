    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My professional journey in IT began in 2016 with a focus on web development. Over time, my curiosity and determination led me to acquire expertise in a variety of tools such as Python, Shell, API, and integrations. My ability to troubleshoot and utilize online resources proved invaluable in my role as a cloud system administrator. Now, as a technical consultant, I continue to embrace the challenge of learning something new every day.</p>
    <p>With a deep passion for technology and continuous improvement, I also possess language skills in Czech, English, French, and a little Spanish, enriching my ability to communicate and collaborate across diverse teams.</p>
